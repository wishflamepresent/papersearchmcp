## Overview

`paper-search-mcp` is a Python-based MCP server that enables users to search and download academic papers from various platforms. It provides tools for searching papers (e.g., `search_arxiv`) and downloading PDFs (e.g., `download_arxiv`), making it ideal for researchers and AI-driven workflows. Built with the MCP Python SDK, it integrates seamlessly with LLM clients like Claude Desktop.

## Features

- **Multi-Source Support**: Search and download papers from arXiv, PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv, Google Scholar, IACR ePrint Archive, Semantic Scholar.
- **Deep Research Ready**: Provides the standardized `search` and `fetch` tools required by OpenAI Deep Research and ChatGPT connectors.
- **Standardized Output**: Papers are returned in a consistent dictionary format via the `Paper` class.
- **Asynchronous Tools**: Efficiently handles network requests using `httpx`.
- **MCP Integration**: Compatible with MCP clients for LLM context enhancement.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily add new academic platforms by extending the `academic_platforms` module.
